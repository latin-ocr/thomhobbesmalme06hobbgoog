Tms poem, which is represented by our author in his στιγμαὶ,
published in 1657, 66 having been “made long sinee” (ses
vol. vii. p. 389), appears to have been written in the interval
between the suooession 61 1616 first pupil‚ William Lord
Cavendish‚ to the title of Earl 61 Devonshire‚ and his death,
thetis to say, between 1626 and 1628 :-

Sed Dominum, mea 116666, 66166661 gente vetusta
Orto dat titulos Devonia, Derbia ouras.

’166666 Dominam spectes 6

Amborumque vide sobolem3 imprimisque puellam
Dignam qua 6616666 Superi, binosque puellos
Angelieos 6 a

It was probably laid aeide, when Hobbes on the death 61 1616

pnpil lest the Cavendish family sor a while: “nimium negleoss
tus abivit”: (Vrra Carm. exp). And if the date of 1636 16
eorreetly attributed by Anthony Wood to the first edition, it
was published just before his return from abroad in 1637 with
his second pupil‚ the son of the late Earl.

The only editions that the Editor has met with, are the quarto
edition without date or title-page, which seems to be that to
which Anthony Wood assigna the date of 1636: and the oe-
tawo edition of 1678, published by Hobbes’ 6661661166,Ἦῦ-
liam Crook, along with an English translation by “ a Person
61 Quality.”
